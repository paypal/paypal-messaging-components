                    Easy Payments lets you make equal monthly payments over the term of the offer to pay off your
                    purchase, including any interest, if applicable.
                </p>

                    The total cost of your purchase will be divided into substantially equal monthly payments. If the
                    merchant ships your items separately, the total cost of each shipment will be divided into
                    substantially equal payments.

                <p>
                    The minimum payment on your account will include your Easy Payments purchase, as well as any other
                    purchases you&apos;ve made using PayPal Credit.
