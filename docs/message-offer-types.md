# Message Offer Types

## Abbreviations by Locale

The following are abbreviations used in reference to various messages and files

Offer Type (or `offerType` as seen in the `banners/` directory JSON files), is the same as the file name, but it is uppercased and uses a colon in place of the underscore. As an example, the file name `ezp_any_eqz` becomes the offer type `EZP:ANY:EQZ`.
